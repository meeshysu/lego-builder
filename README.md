# Lego Builder
In this project, you'll find a fun and interesting way of selecting lego images and creating your own combinations. Not only can you choose your own heads, torsos and legs, you can combine the different names of each lego piece together, forming your own piece! In this project we utilized used a webpack with VS to mix things up. Make sure you read how to run the project below to do it correctly. We used many things we were taught this year, such as our modules, promises, jQuery and now introducing scss!
